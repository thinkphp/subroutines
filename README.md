## What is a subroutine?

- a **subroutine** (also is called **subprogram**) is an abstraction of a process that is **called**.
- the **caller** passes arguments to the subroutine that accept them as parameters.
- while the caller waits, the subroutine executes or evaluates its bodym which may cause side effect to the global system state, and optionally returns the results to the caller.
